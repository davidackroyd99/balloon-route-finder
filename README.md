# Hot Air Balloon Route Finder

This api that finds valid hot air balloon routes was created in early 2020 for the MET Office hackathon at Exeter University. To build it I parsed a load of GRIB2 wind data provided as part of the hackathon and then did a search to find a safe route that took into account altitude and wind speed and provided a safe landing.
