# Hot Air Balloon Route Finder

This api finds valid hot air balloon routes and was created in early 2020 for the MET Office hackathon at Exeter University. To build it I parsed a load of GRIB2 wind data provided as part of the hackathon and then did a search to find a safe route that took into account altitude and wind speed and provided a safe landing. My team won one of two top prizes.
